DAC-pic18F24Q10-test.X - A complete MPLABX (v5.50) project demonstrating scopetext
			 using a PIC18F24Q10 with its 5bit DAC.

                         The DAC and processor's oscillator speed are configured
			 using MCC (Microchip Code Configurator), and so can easily
			 be changed as needed.
